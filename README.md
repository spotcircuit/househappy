npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure
- `/src/app` - Next.js app router pages
- `/src/components` - Reusable React components
- `/src/data` - Mock data for demonstrations
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions

## Notes
- The application uses hot module reloading, so manual restarts are rarely needed
- Mock data is used to simulate real-world conversations and violations
